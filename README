Building an alternative view of the open source applications written in Python


HOW TO RUN
-----------
Create a JSON file in the conf/ directory similar to the already exising ones
and run
$ python bin/parse.py conf/yourfile.json




SOME PLANNING
---------------
- Have a json file describe the source that needs to be analyzed
  Where to download the files, how to update them
  (e.g. a packaged file having a new version or a git or SVN repository)

- process and analyze the files and create a static display with a few static
  json files with meta-data

- collect more meta-data in an SQLite database to provide a searchable interface


COMMENTS
----------
In order to find out which token has which token number the mapping can
be found here: /usr/lib/python2.7/token.py
Apparently if I type pydoc  tokenize on the command line, I get the list
